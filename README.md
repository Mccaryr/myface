# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was designed with React(Typescript), Node, GraphQL, MongoDB, AWS RDS, and AWS S3. This is a hybrid facebook myspace clone with the intention to bring the best of both worlds by connecting friends and giving users creative freedom to alter their profile page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`(cd into client folder first)
This will start the client side code and opens localhost:3000 in the browser

### `npm run server`(cd into server folder first)
This will start the node server that uses GraphQL to distribute data.
